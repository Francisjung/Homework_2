# <Francis Jung's Portfolio>

## Description

- In this project I attempted to create a portfolio for my future work.
- While I expected this to be simple it turned out to be more difficult than I first thought, and in completign it I now have a much better understanding of CSS and HTML
- The page is split into a few sections; the header which holds links to other parts of the page, a main element which holds all the content for the page, and 4 setions which hold content realted to each topic.
- This page utilizes media querries, making the elements rearrange based on the size of the display.

## What I Learned
- As mentioned above this project proved to more challeneging than I initially expected. Specifically I had lots of trouble with the CSS aspect of the project.
- I learned that flex boxes are extremely powerful, and that I should do my best to recognize situations where using them would be advantageous.
- As well I learned a little bit about CSS animation, though I did not have time to implement it. I plan in the future to use this specifically in the header title.
